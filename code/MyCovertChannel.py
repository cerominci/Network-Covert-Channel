        For the first step, we create a binary message using the provided functions in the class CCB. We then check if binary message has an even or odd length.
        This is not necessary for we know that it will be of even length, but for generalization I wanted to add this. CC capacity measurement is not affected by that part.
        To maximize covert channel capacity we send 2 bits each time, as per the HW description.

        In RFC 1035 the following value-class pairs are given:
        IN - 1
        CS - 2 (obsolete)
        CH - 3
        HS - 4

        To maximize CC capacity, we send 2 bits. But to do this we also must use CS - 2, which is obsolete. This reduces stealth of the channel. 
        We then iterate over the binary messages, selecting 2 bits each time. We then encode them, craft the DNS packet for the provided hostname and send this DNS packet.
        Resulting covert channel capacity was 14.263304180843734 bits/second.
